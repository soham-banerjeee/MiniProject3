# MiniProject3 Part1
I have created an API for the users. This supports all the CRUD operations,including creating an user,retrieving an user details,updating an user details and deleting a certain user.

## Problem Description
For this assignment you need to follow this tutorial to create the application.

https://www.codementor.io/olawalealadeusi896/restful-api-with-python-flask-framework-and-postgres-db-part-1-kbrwbygx5 (Links to an external site.)

Upload it to Github and submit a link to the repo branch called "part1"

## Solution
My API supports the following actions at the following URL extensions:

- Create an user: http://127.0.0.1/api/v1/users/ [POST]
- User Login: http://127.0.0.1/api/v1/users/login [POST]
- Retrieve all users: http://127.0.0.1/api/v1/users/ [GET]
- Retrieve an single user by ID: http://127.0.0.1/api/v1/users/<id> [GET]
- Update an user details: http://127.0.0.1/api/v1/users/<id> [PUT]
- Delete a blogpost: http://127.0.0.1/api/v1/users/<id> [DELETE]
  
  
Please find a screenshot of the user login:
