# MiniProject3 Part2
I have created an API for the blogposts. This supports all the CRUD operations,including creating a blog,reading a blog,updating a blog and deleting a certain blog.

## Problem Description
For this assignment you need to follow this tutorial to create the application.

https://www.codementor.io/olawalealadeusi896/building-a-restful-blog-apis-using-python-and-flask-part-2-l9y8awusp (Links to an external site.)

Upload it to Github and submit a link to the repo branch called "part2"

## Solution
My API supports the following actions at the following URL extensions:

- Create a blogpost: http://127.0.0.1/api/v1/blogposts/ [POST]
- Retrieve all blogposts: http://127.0.0.1/api/v1/blogposts/ [GET]
- Retrieve a single blogpost by ID: http://127.0.0.1/api/v1/blogposts/<id> [GET]
- Update a blogpost: http://127.0.0.1/api/v1/blogposts/<id> [PUT]
- Delete a blogpost: http://127.0.0.1/api/v1/blogposts/<id> [DELETE]
  
  
Please find a screenshot of all the blogposts:
